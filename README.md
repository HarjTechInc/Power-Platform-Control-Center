# Power Platform Control Center  
**Developed by HarjTech**  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Power Platform Control Center** is a mobile-friendly Power Apps solution that allows Microsoft Power Platform administrators to monitor and manage their tenant from anywhere. Unlike the Microsoft Center of Excellence (CoE) toolkit, this app focuses on simplicity and accessibility—perfect for organizations just getting started with their Power Platform journey.  

This solution provides a **centralized view** of:  
- All **environments** in the tenant  
- **Apps** and who is building them  
- **Flows** and their creators  
- **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies** applied across the tenant  

---

## 💡 Why This App?  
While the Microsoft Center of Excellence (CoE) toolkit is powerful, it requires a **complex setup** (Dataverse or Azure SQL, scheduled data syncs, and multiple moving parts). Not every organization is ready for that investment of time and resources.  

**HarjTech’s Power Platform Control Center** offers a **lightweight alternative**:  
- **No Dataverse required**  
- **No Azure SQL setup**  
- Uses **only free Microsoft data sources**  
- **Plug-and-play deployment** — minimal configuration needed

## 🚀 Key Features  
1. **Mobile-First Experience** – Monitor tenant activity on the go  
2. **Tenant Insights at a Glance** – See all environments, apps, flows, and DLP policies in one place  
3. **Automatic Data Retrieval** – Uses admin access (System Administrator role) to pull information directly  
4. **Quick Setup** – Deploy in minutes without advanced infrastructure  
5. **Ideal for New Power Platform Teams** – Perfect for early-stage governance and oversight

## 🔧 How It Works  
Once deployed, the app connects to your Power Platform environment using the credentials of a System Administrator. From there, it:  
- Retrieves all environments available to the admin  
- Displays a list of all apps and flows within each environment  
- Shows **who is building what** (maker information)  
- Lists all Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies configured in the tenant  

---

## 🛠 Use Cases  
- **Startup & SMB IT Teams** – Maintain visibility without heavy infrastructure  
- **Power Platform Beginners** – Learn what's possible without Dataverse overhead  
- **Governance Lite** – Keep tabs on tenant activity before moving to a full CoE
